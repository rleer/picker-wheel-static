# Picker Wheel Static

Collection of picker wheels implemented in HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.
 
## Version 1

Looks good, has proper spin logic but is not scalable due to the hardcoded `clip-path` property of the wheel segments.

## Version 2

Has the same spin logic as version 1 and looks very similar, but is scalable, i.e. you can adjust the number of wheel segments.
But the position of the names is not ideal.
Position values are hardcoded and probably do not work well, when more wheel segments were used.
